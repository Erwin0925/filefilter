# File Filter Configuration
# This configuration defines how files should be filtered and validated

# Input file path (relative to src/main/resources/sourcefile/)
inputFile: "data.csv"

# File type: CSV, EXCEL, TXT (case-insensitive)
fileType: CSV

# Delimiter for TXT files (only used when fileType is TXT)
# Examples: ",", "|", "/", "\t"
delimiter: ","

# File encoding (default: UTF-8)
encoding: UTF-8

# Number of header lines to skip (headers will be copied to output files)
skipHeaderLines: 1

# Expected total number of columns
# Set to null or omit if no column count validation is needed
expectedTotalColumn: 10

# Validation rules (AND logic - all rules must pass)
# Column indices are 1-based
validations:
  # Example 1: Column 1 must start with "99" and have length of 7
  - column: 1
    notEmpty: true
    regex: "^99\\d{5}$"

  # Example 2: Column 3 must be one of specific values
  - column: 3
    valueInList: ["101", "110", "040"]

  # Example 3: Column 5 must not be empty
  - column: 5
    notEmpty: true

  # Example 4: Column 7 must have length between 12-13 characters
  - column: 7
    notEmpty: true
    regex: ".{12,13}"

# Output configuration
output:
  # Base name for filtered output file (extension auto-appended)
  outputFileName: "FilteredData"

  # Whether to write rejected records to a separate file
  needRejectedData: true

  # Base name for rejected data file (only used if needRejectedData is true)
  rejectedFileName: "RejectedData"
